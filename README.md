# About me
Hello, everyone reading this, as of the realization of this project i'm a computer engineering student, in which i got interested in Data Anlsysis and Cibersecurity, i'll be developing some projects around those areas in future repositories, keep in mind i can make mistakes but i'll do my best to always deliver the best i can offer, and of course i'll be updating some of these projects if nedded, feel free to comment on my work so i can see if i can do something different any kind of critiscim is welcome, i'll be more than happy to keep developing my skills around that, so without further to do, Welcome everyone, let me introduce you to the next project you are about to read, the following was executed during my bootcamp of Data Analyst Jr. so like always feel free to use it modify it or add comments about it.

First of all lets talk about the tools i got to use during my development:

## Tools
* Python (Version 3.12.3)
* SQL (I personally noramly use the administration platform postgreSQL/PgAdmin, but feel free to use the one you prefer such as MySQL Workbench)
* Power BI (Mostly for the dashboard and insight presentation)

## Project Structure 
* Datawarehouse on SQL (Data storage)
* Pipeline on Python (Extract)
* Cleaning and enrichment of data (Transform)
* Load data from datalake to datawarehouse (Load)
* Data Analysis (I'm going to use a python notebook so i can leave my insights)
* Power BI Dashboard (Then i will add a drive link so you can get to see the dashboards created, for the data presentation)
